    #"ITALY became the first team to reach the knockout stage of Euro 2020 as midfielder Manuel Locatelli scored twice in a 3-0 win over Switzerland in Rome on Wednesday, while Wales moved to the brink of joining them by beating Turkey.The Azzurri, now unbeaten in 29 matches and having won their last 10 games without conceding a goal, sit first in Group A and are guaranteed a top-two finish and last-16 berth.We played well, we wanted to win at all costs, Italy coach Roberto Mancini told RAI.They started well, it was not easy to win a second game in five days.Mancini's men, looking to win Italy a second European title after their sole success in 1968, host Wales in their final group game on Sunday, with top spot up for grabs.A new star shone for Italy at the Stadio Olimpico, where they had brushed aside Turkey 3-0 in the tournament's opening match last week, as Sassuolo's Locatelli scored twice before Ciro Immobile's late third.Captain Giorgio Chiellini had an early effort ruled out by VAR for handball, before the 36-year-old defender was forced off with what appeared to be a thigh injury.But the hosts always looked the more dangerous side and took the lead in the 26th minute.Locatelli played a wonderful volleyed pass to his Sassuolo teammate Domenico Berardi on the wing, who powered to the byline and picked out Locatelli for a simple tap-in.The three points and a place in the knockout phase for the fourth straight European Championship were all but secured less than seven minutes after the interval, when a flowing move ended with Locatelli driving a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from outside the box.Immobile had wasted a couple of earlier chances but did grab his second goal of the tournament in the 89th minute, curling a low effort past Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer.Switzerland will now likely have to beat Turkey in Baku on Sunday to reach the next round.Impressive Wales see off Turkey After drawing 1-1 with the Swiss in their opening Group A game, Wales now have four points from two matches after goals from Aaron Ramsey and Connor Roberts saw off a disappointing Turkey 2-0.You'd like to think so, but we'll have to wait and see, said Wales captain Gareth Bale when asked if his team had done enough to get through.If you'd offered us four points at the start we would've bitten your hand off.Senol Gunes' side, roared on by the majority of the crowd in Azerbaijan, have lost both of their games without scoring and face a mountain to climb if they are to qualify.Wales, semi-finalists five years ago, should have won more convincingly, but wasted several chances including a second-half penalty which was blazed over by Bale.Up to 4,000 Turkish fans travelled for the game, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but Wales immediately were on the front foot and Ramsey wasted two excellent chances early on.He made no mistake three minutes before the break, though, chesting down Bale's pass and slotting home.Bale, whose future at Real Madrid is uncertain, won a penalty just after the hour mark but was uncharacteristically wayward from the spot.Robert Page's Wales grabbed the second goal their performance deserved in stoppage time, as Bale danced through and teed up Roberts to sweep into the net.In the first match of the day, Russia defeated neighbours Finland 1-0 in Saint Petersburg courtesy of Aleksei Miranchuk's goal just before half-time to pick up their first points in Group B.It blows open the section after Russia lost 3-0 to Belgium in their opening game at the weekend. Finland had beaten Denmark 1-0 in Copenhagen on Saturday, a game completely overshadowed by Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest.Belgium to make Eriksen gesture On Thursday, Belgium could all but confirm their spot in the last 16 when they take on Denmark in Copenhagen.The game will be the Danes' first since Eriksen had to be revived on the pitch at the Parken Stadium against Finland on Saturday.The players and crowd, with up to 25,000 fans allowed to attend, will pay tribute to the Inter Milan player with a minute's applause in the 10th minute.Several of our players have played with him, said Eriksen's Inter Milan teammate and Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who added that the players would kick the ball out of play in the 10th minute.But tomorrow we'll be there to win the game, which promises to be difficult.Depending on the result of the first game of the day between Ukraine and North Macedonia in Group C, the Netherlands could qualify with a victory over Austria in Amsterdam. - AFP",
    #"THE ANNOUNCEMENT by the Namibian government that common ground has been reached with Germany over colonial mass atrocities and massacres is a giant step on an issue that has remained unresolved for more than 110 years.Though long overdue, it is nothing less than progress in humanity: Germany has finally admitted it committed genocide when it intentionally wiped out large sections of the Nama and Ovaherero populations; Germany will also make a public apology accompanied by documenting the gruesome war crimes in a manner that allows the story of the victims to be told.That progress is cause for celebration.Namibians should not let this progress get buried in the understandable disagreements about the monetary figures and definition of the compensation.If there are lessons to take from issues such as the Holocaust, determining monetary compensation is the most complex part, but one that can be addressed over time.For a start, it is important for Namibians to be on the same page among themselves. For those not affected by the genocide, especially government officials, it is crucial to deploy a high degree of sensitivity and empathy towards descendants of the victims.Prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila's statement in parliament this week already seemed dismissive about sections of the Nama and Ovaherero communities who she said excluded themselves early on when negotiations started.It would be a grave mistake if, for instance, a Swapo majority in parliament was used to adopt the draft joint declaration with Germany at the exclusion of opposition parties and traditional authorities that have not sided with the government.And for many other Namibians not affected by the genocide, it is also a time to step back and reflect on the horror and near-extermination the Herero and Nama people suffered. More than that, we as a country need to honour that moment in history.Let the monetary compensation not divide the country further.What is important is to avoid settling for the German offer just because the government can. It is also worth noting that 'individual' efforts in the past to claim reparations from Germany and German organisations, including costly legal actions, did not succeed.Germany is probably correct at this stage in not calling it's offer of 1,1 billion Euro (N$18 billion) over 30 years reparations, although our government insists it is. That compensation is mere tokenism to accompany the main step of classifying the atrocities as genocide and to tender a public apology. It amounts to the equivalent of the about N$15 billion of voluntary development aid that Germany had provided to Namibia by 2019.Besides, how was the N$18 billion arrived at, considering the lives lost, the pain and suffering of the direct victims as well as the trauma passed on to generation after generation? What was taken into account to determine the so-called reparation price put on that which was lost in the past and the legacy it continues to leave? The manner in which this agreement is finalised is key to closing this important chapter of Namibia's history. Now that we have reached this stage, the Namibian government should improve by being more transparent about the process and redouble its consultative process, especially with the parties that have been left out. President Hage Geingob has always emphasised consultations, saying “exclusivity spells conflict and inclusivity spells harmony”.It is time to walk the talk. The government needs to use the remaining window of opportunity to be seen to act in good faith and to tick key boxes before signing up to the agreement.",

    #"We just want quarantine facilities revived - MFA",
    #"CHAIRPERSON of the Mangetti Farmers Association (MFA) Ismael Shailemo says the association has long forgotten the dream of the removal of the red line cordon fence and would rather advocate for the revival of quarantine facilities in the regions north of the red line.We advocated for the red line to be removed many years ago, but nothing came of it. Most of our leaders didn't want to support us when we said the red line should go, maybe they can support the revival of quarantine facilities so that our cattle can be sold outside,” said Shailemo.MFA is an association compromised of more than 350 members from the northern regions, who are into livestock production.The issue of the red line was re-ignited last month when Affirmative Reposition (AR)'s Job Amupanda filed a case with the High Court in Windhoek to have it removed. The cordon fence encompasses Omaheke, Kunene, Oshikoto, Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, Kavango West and East and Zambezi regions.Livestock north of the red line cannot be sold outside the country while farmers south of the red line can sell their livestock anywhere.The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform could not comment saying it awaits outcome of the case from the courts."
